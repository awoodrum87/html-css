<h3>How to Make Mama&rsquo;s Recipe: The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Beat butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy
Stir in pudding powder, milk, and vanilla extract.
Beat in eggs.
Add remaining dry ingredients (flour, salt, baking soda) and stir until combined.
Stir in chocolate chips.
Place 1.5-inch balls of dough 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown.
<h3>EXPERT TIPS</h3>
Use an ice-cream scoop to make perfectly shaped cookies. Level off the dough on the edge of the bowl for perfectly round cookies.
If you didn't think these cookies could get any better, think again! Get creative use with 1/2 cup each of semisweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips or butterscotch chips instead of the 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips. OMG these are good!
